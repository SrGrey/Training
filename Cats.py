# The code below is my solution for test's task 
# this solution was not verified by advanced Python developer so could smell bad :P   But it looks working
#
# Task description:
''' Write the classes:

AbstractCat class, which is initialized with no arguments. Is able to:
*eat* eat. For every 10 units of food, the weight increases by 1 unit until it becomes 100, and does not grow further. 
If at one meal the amount of food is not a multiple of 10, the remainder is stored, and then added to the new meal.
- return a string representation as <Class name> (weight).

Kitten class, inherited from cat with weight argument. Knows how to meow subtly:
*meow* returns the string "meow ..."
It also knows how to sleep *sleep* returns the string Snore, repeated as many times as the number 5 fits in the weight.

Class Cat, inherited from a kitten with weight and name arguments. Knows how to meow loudly (meow):
"MEOW ..."
and return your name (get_name). Also knows how to catch mice:
*catch_mice** returns a string: Got it! '''
